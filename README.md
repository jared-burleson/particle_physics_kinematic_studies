# Kinematic Study of Particle Physics Processes

**Note:** This is still a major work in progress. I am currently working on moving over my code to github and condensing it in a generally applicable form.

This project is a collection of python code useful in analyzing kinematics of HEP processes. 

The particular application of this code, of which I am currently working on, is the study of ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?$\textit{H}^0&space;\rightarrow&space;gg&space;\rightarrow&space;b\overline{b}b\overline{b}$) 
against ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?$\textit{H}^0&space;\rightarrow&space;b\overline{b}g&space;\rightarrow&space;b\overline{b}b\overline{b}$).

However, the goal of utilizing a github for my code is to generalize a process for studying kinematic data on any particular process in particle physics.

**To get started:**

This code is written in python, but nothing that is done in the code is particularly difficult. I am studying physics after all.
Nevertheless, a background or understanding of python is probably important to reading the code that is used.
The project itself is purely based on data science analysis so I mainly stick to using the most basic of python libraries with the addition of the pandas library class in order to help express large data in appropriate lists, as well as graphics libraries for later analysis.
