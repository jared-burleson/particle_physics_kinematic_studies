# Kinematic Study of Particle Physics Processes

**Note:** This is still a major work in progress. I am currently working on moving over my code to github and condensing it in a generally applicable form.

This project is a collection of python code useful in analyzing kinematics of HEP processes. 

The particular application of this code, of which I am currently working on, is the study of ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?$\textit{H}^0&space;\rightarrow&space;gg&space;\rightarrow&space;b\overline{b}b\overline{b}$) 
against ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?$\textit{H}^0&space;\rightarrow&space;b\overline{b}g&space;\rightarrow&space;b\overline{b}b\overline{b}$).

However, the goal of utilizing a github for my code is to generalize a process for studying kinematic data on any particular process in particle physics.
